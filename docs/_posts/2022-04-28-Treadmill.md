I was messaging Reagan yesterday about so called "career progression" thing. At best, it is a treadmill where you eventually get a bit more stuff. At worst, it is a total scam.

But if you look at it this way, many other pursuits begin to look like treadmills too: say you wanted to master painting. But learning to paint is anything but a scam. So where does the difference lie?

So, according to my very limited knowledge of existentialism, we are all doomed to die, and thus the way to break free is to be authentic to yourself. How do you do that here? I suppose the only thing you could realistically do is climb with your eyes wide open. For the sake of this analogy, a mountain is something worthwhile, and a treadmill is a complete waste of time.

If you are doing something simply for the purpose of climbing higher, then you're probably climbing a treadmill. If you are doing something for its own sake, then it is fine, and you're probably climbing a mountain.

This framework solves a couple of problems. Say that you were a scholar, churning out papers. And your purpose was to churn out those papers to advance your position. Then you're on a treadmill. But if you were writing papers because you actually wanted to further research, or you wanted to learn more, then you're on a mountain.

One key point is there's no way around climbing. Most things worthwhile in life have their treasures tucked away in somewhere high. Climbing is part of the deal.

But what if you realise you're on a treadmill? I think there are three things you can do here:
1. Continue
   Pretend you didn't realise anything and carry on.
2. Stop
   Realise that you /have/ the option to stop climbing. You don't have to keep on 'progressing'. This is the way to fight back, and reclaim some part of yourself. Floating, in the middle of the sea, is not necessarily a bad thing.
3. Turn the treadmill into your mountain
   Consciously decide: "Yes, this is exactly what I want to do. I only have several decades of my life left before I die, and this is /exactly/ how I want to spend them." Then, there is no problem at all. If you wanted to grind away at your job, then go for it. There is nothing wrong with it, because you know what you're getting yourself into, and you know the consequences.

Is this the only sane way to approach this?
