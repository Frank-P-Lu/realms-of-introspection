When you feel guilty about having not done work, stop and think before you spiral down into the abyss of not _doing_ work.

Feeling guilty in this situation is not helpful, but there is nothing you can do about the feeling of guilt itself. You only have control over your actions and in this moment, you have two options:

1. Wallow in your guilt and let it consume you.
2. Get on with your work

If you pick option one, generally what happens is you will feel terrible. As a result of feeling terrible, you want to do something to make yourself feel better. 

Of course, of the things that make you feel better, there are those that require a lot of effort (such as exercise), and those that require minimal effort. The latter category is filled with vices and distractions. 
In your disgruntled state of mind, it is not hard to see which one you will pick. And after another 'bad' choice, you feel guilty, and thus the cycle of despair continues all over again.

What about option two? Of course, this is only rational course of action. But in a twisted kind of way, your mind will not allow you to simply _get on with it_. You feel guilty, and guilt demands punishment. In the moment, it is excruciating, hence the need to stop and think. 

First, forgive yourself. Acknowledge that you've wasted your time, but berating yourself for it will not get you your time back. (There is after all, no use crying over spilt milk.) Take a step back and assess your options. The only choice that matters is the one you make right now.
